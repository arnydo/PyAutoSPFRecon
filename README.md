# SPFYBind
Goal of this project is to build upon the excellent work by @Relkci with https://github.com/Relkci/AutoSPFRecon.
This Docker-Compose approach takes a few specified parameters (domain name, IP address, Email, etc) and automatically spins up a BIND DNS server with the appropriate configuration; including query logging.

This is very much a work in progress but will be a great tool to add to the toolbox.

##TODO
* Basic BIND configuration
* Custom Zone configuration
* Log queries to file
